PeerPicks Admin Dashboard | Project READMEThis project is a high-performance Admin Management System built with a modern tech stack. It features a robust Node.js/Express backend with strict Zod validation and a Next.js frontend styled with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.🚀 Tech StackFrontendFramework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)Styling: Tailwind CSS (Dark Theme optimized)Animations: Framer MotionIcons: Lucide ReactForm Handling: Axios for multipart/form-data (image uploads)BackendRuntime: Node.js / Express.jsDatabase: MongoDB via MongooseValidation: Zod (Schema-based DTOs)Security: Bcrypt (Password Hashing), JWT AuthenticationFile Handling: Multer (Local storage for profile pictures)🛠 Features1. Advanced User ManagementCRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete users directly from the admin panel.Role-Based Access: Automatic defaulting to user role with the ability for Admins to escalate permissions.Age Validation: Integrated Zod logic ensures all users are at least 13 years old based on their Date of Birth.2. Secure AuthenticationAutomated Hashing: All passwords created via the Admin panel are hashed using bcrypt (10 salts) before being stored in the database.Data Integrity: Unique email indexing and case-insensitive normalization.3. Multimedia SupportProfile Pictures: Support for image uploads via multipart/form-data.Static Serving: Images are stored in /uploads and served statically for high-speed retrieval.4. High-End UI/UXResponsive Forms: Mobile-first grid layouts for complex data entry (e.g., Gender and DOB side-by-side).Dark Mode UI: Custom [color-scheme:dark] integration for native browser elements like Date Pickers.📂 Project StructurePlaintext├── backend
